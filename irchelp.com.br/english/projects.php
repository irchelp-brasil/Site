            <li><p><a href="https://wiki.irchelp.com.br/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">IRChelp Wiki</a>: The Wikihelp project is intended to provide IRC users with tutorials written in wiki form. We believe this makes it more organized and easier to understand. An ease with which wikis can be written by any user was also a factor that led to the adoption the <a href="https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/MediaWiki/pt-br" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">MediaWikia</a> tool. Anyone can create or edit an IRC tutorial on Wikihelp, just sign up and and make sure that the issue is has to be IRC related.</p></li>

            <li><p><a href="https://github.com/irchelp-brasil/CloudBot/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CloudBot Tucuju:</a>
              Tucuju is a functional ClouBot in Phyton language for managing IRC channels. It is a variation of <a href="https://snoonet.org/gonzobot/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">gonzobot</a> of <a href="https://snoonet.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Snoonet Network</a> with the only difference that it has information about commands and "speech" in Portuguese. The Portuguese code will be available on GitHub for anyone who wants to download any specific part or all of it. The translation will be slow, but anyone who wants to help is welcome. Just download the bot and translate any part.</p></li>

            <li><p><a href="http://www.interirc.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">InterIRC:</a> This project verilly, belongs to Jacksoow, root of the <a href="https://svipchat.webnode.com.br" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SVipChat Network</a>. The goal of the project, is interconnect the networks to each other only through the relayer by channels, using <a href="https://github.com/jlu5/PyLink" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pylink</a> software, since few networks want to make a traditional link. Later I had this idea without knowing that he already had it. The project is in testing. If you prefer, access the project by <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.telegram.messenger&hl=pt_BR" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">App Telegram</a> through the link <a href="https://t.me/joinchat/B7uUCk1AYBXTS-B6qya3rw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#Brasil - IRC Chat Relay</a></p>
