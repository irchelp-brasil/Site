            <p class="recuo">As has been said before, the IRChelp Network came up with the help of those people who would like to know more about IRC, from the simple command until the creation of a network.
            When I have these questions, I didn't find nobody to help me, or guide to get this information or still accomplish what I wanted to do.</p>
            <p class="recuo">I start accessing the IRC from 1995 until the end of 1998. After, I returned to use in 2016. Still in 1995 it was very difficult anyone to "give" you any information on IRC, ask for help it was like an insult. Today we have a better search engine, at that time we had <a href="https://www.techtudo.com.br/listas/noticia/2016/03/alem-do-google-cade-aonde-altavista-e-outros-fizeram-historia.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cadê, Altavista</a> etc, and yet there is not much literature and as they existed was in English.
            With all this in mind, the idea of ​​creating a help network came up. After came the idea of ​​creating the site.</p>
            <p class="recuo">After having an idea of ​​the Network and later on the site, when I was searching irchelp domains, I find out that someone already had that same idea in 1993. An original IRChelp was created as an help IRC channel on the Networks <a href="http://www.efnet.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">EFnet</a>, <a href="https://freenode.net/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Freenode</a> e <a href="http://www.ircnet.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">IRCnet</a>.
            As they themselves report on the site – <a href="http://www.irchelp.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">IRChelp.org</a> - , they are a group of just over 20 people who maintain the service and the site until this day with the same goal.</p>
            <p class="recuo">Anyone who has been on the IRC “road” for a long time knows that finding help is not easy, we are happy to hear that there are others who are available in give their time to help - as a hobby - other people to demystify some IRC-related issues. We look forward to evolving our work and contributing to whoever we want. Hugs.
